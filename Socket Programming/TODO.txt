Designing a simple messaging app as a socket programming project is a great way to test and enhance your knowledge of network communication. Here are some high-level requirements and features you can consider for your project:

(IMP) 1. User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users should be able to create accounts with usernames and passwords.
   - Implement a basic authentication mechanism to verify users' identities.

(IMP) 2. User-to-User Messaging:**
   - Users can send and receive text messages in real-time.
   - Messages should be displayed in a chat-like interface.

(IMP) 3. Group Messaging:**
   - Users can create and join group chats.
   - Group chats allow multiple users to communicate in a shared conversation.

4. Presence Status:**
   - Users can set their online, offline, or busy status.
   - Other users can see the status of their contacts.

5. Contact Management:**
   - Users can add, remove, and manage contacts.
   - Contacts can be organized into lists or groups.

6. Message History:**
   - The app should store and display message history, allowing users to view previous conversations.

7. Notifications:**
   - Implement notifications to alert users of new messages when the app is not in focus.

8. Emojis and File Sharing:**
   - Allow users to send emojis or other multimedia elements.
   - Implement basic file sharing for images, documents, etc.

(IMP) 9. Security:**
   - Use encryption to protect messages in transit.
   - Implement basic security practices to prevent unauthorized access to messages.

10. Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    - Develop clients for multiple platforms (e.g., desktop, web, mobile) to facilitate communication between users using different devices.

(NEXT-IMP) 11. User Interface (UI):**
    - Design an intuitive and user-friendly UI to facilitate messaging and interaction.

12. Error Handling and Reliability:**
    - Implement error handling to deal with network issues and ensure message delivery reliability.

13. Logging and Debugging:**
    - Include logging and debugging features to help with troubleshooting and monitoring.

14. Offline Messaging:**
    - Implement the ability to send messages when the recipient is offline, with the message delivered when they come online.

15. Scalability:**
    - Design the app architecture to handle a growing number of users and messages.

(NEXT-IMP) 16. Testing:**
    - Develop unit tests and integration tests to ensure the app functions as expected.

(NEXT-IMP) 17. Documentation:**
    - Create documentation that explains how to use the app, its architecture, and any APIs for future development.

(NEXT-IMP) 18. Deployment:**
    - Deploy the server component on a remote host or cloud server for accessibility.

(NEXT-IMP) 19. Chat History Export:**
    - Allow users to export their chat history for backup or reference.

(NEXT-IMP) 20. Search Functionality:**
    - Implement a search feature to easily find and navigate through past conversations.

**21. User Profiles:**
    - Enable users to set profile pictures and add personal information to their profiles.
