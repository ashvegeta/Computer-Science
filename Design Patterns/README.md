1. Singleton Pattern:

		Purpose: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
		
		Implementation: Implementing a singleton is straightforward in many programming languages. It involves creating a class with a		  private constructor and a static method to access the single instance.
	
		Impact: Singleton is widely used for managing resources, configuration settings, and objects that should have a single point 
		of control and shared state across an application.
		
2. Factory Method Pattern:

		Purpose: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
	
		Implementation: Create an interface or an abstract base class for object creation. Concrete subclasses implement the factory 
		method to produce objects.
	
		Impact: The factory method promotes loose coupling, making it easier to extend and maintain code. It's valuable when you need		  to create objects with varying behaviors.

3. Observer Pattern:

		Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notifi		  ed and updated automatically.
	
		Implementation: In the observer pattern, you typically have a subject (observable) and one or more observers (subscribers). 
		When the subject's state changes, it notifies and updates its observers.
	
		Impact: The observer pattern is essential for implementing event handling systems, GUI components, and various real-time 
		systems.

4. Decorator Pattern:

		Purpose: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to 
		subclassing for extending functionality.

		Implementation: Create a set of decorator classes that implement the same interface as the component they wrap. Decorators can		  add behavior before and/or after delegating to the wrapped component.
	
		Impact: Decorators are used for adding features to objects dynamically without altering their structure. They are commonly 
		used in graphical user interface libraries for adding features like window borders, scrollbars, or tooltips.

5. Strategy Pattern:

		Purpose: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose		  the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
	
		Implementation: Create a set of strategy classes, each representing a different algorithm, and have a context class that can 
		switch between strategies.
	
		Impact: The strategy pattern is valuable when you want to select an algorithm at runtime based on specific conditions or user		  preferences. It promotes the "Open/Closed" principle by allowing you to add new algorithms without modifying existing code.
