Ideas for Multi-threading and HPC using Golang:

1. Concurrent Image Processing:
   Create a program that applies filters or image transformations to a collection of images concurrently. You can process each image in a separate goroutine, which can be especially useful for batch processing.

2. Parallel Matrix Multiplication:
   Implement matrix multiplication using goroutines to parallelize the computation. This is a classic example of a task that can benefit from parallelism.

3. Parallel Monte Carlo Simulation:
   Implement a Monte Carlo simulation for a problem of your choice. These simulations involve running numerous random trials, making them suitable for parallel processing.
